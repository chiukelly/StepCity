* Convergent Demo Day 2020
* Problem: Our daily lives have been upended by the pandemic and it has been harder to motivate ourselves to workout. Dr Dunton from USC school of medicine found that 60% of americans report being less active post-pandemic. Now, more than ever, people need a reason to stay active, we need jumpstart to routine activity!
* Solution/Process: Our solution to this problem is Stepcity: the gateway to routine fitness through gamification. We use three main ideas to motivate our user. The first is accomplishment - in our app, we use steps as currency and give the user rewards for meeting both daily and lifetime goals. The second idea is community - we created a friend system to hold everyone accountable. The third idea is creativity - the user would constantly unlock new options, and they would be able to get more and more creative as they meet more goals. This is what keeps people coming back to app. 
* Implementation (front end and back end): In terms of implementation, we used Firebase to manage our back end resources. On the front end, we used SwiftUI in Xcode.
